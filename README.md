# Unit converter for baking

Conversations between most unit systems are pretty straight forward, but cups were always bugging me because they depend on the substance being measured. I used to do a lot of baking and after moving to the US I got tired of googling conversion all the time, so I wrote this little piece of code to help me out. 

I tried to make the interface as straightforward as possible. It only takes one step to enter the conversion query; for example “300 ml of milk into cups”. And it’s able to work with some ambiguity and variation of words being used. 

Plans for future features:
Add temperature conversion
Create UI
